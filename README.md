# Team Fidelity Esports Website

Here's the link: [Link to Website](https://team-fidelity-website.onrender.com/)

Currently, there are four webpages planned for this website, created with simple React as there is currently no need for any input fields or server or APIs. More webpages may be added at a later time as deemed necessary by the management team. All pages are intended to be mobile friendly.

### Page 1: Home Page
Currently this page is unfinished, as the administration team is making the decisions on what to include on the front page.

### Page 2: About Us Page
This page is about the current administration team, including myself. The format was relatively simple, a role and name placed in the center, a picture with a specified height and width depending on the display's current width, and text to the right of the photo. 

### Page 3: Competitive Page
This page is about the competitive aspect of the esports team. It is just text, spaced out with margins and break lines.

### Page 4: Contact Page
This page contains the team's current email address as well as a link to the team's twitter page. The email includes a mail:to built into the link to open the user's mail application, and the twitter link automatically pops up in a new window via a target="_blank", with a rel="noopener noreferrer" to prevent the common fraud attacks.

### Logs:
Switched from Heroku to Render since the free tier is no longer available from Heroku.
