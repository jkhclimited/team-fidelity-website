I am a 21 year old Filipino and Thai gamer, who does what he can to constantly chase his dreams! I go by the pronouns He/Him. I am the Founder of Team Fidelity, I wanted to create a safe haven, a sanctuary to all gamers who want to get their foot through the door into the competitive scene. This was one of my biggest dreams although, everyone here in Fidelity now shares that dream along with me. Not only did I compete in Valorant, I also coach Valorant! Some things people don't know about me is that, I suffer from Chronic Depression and i've been battling depression for 9+ years now- BUT DONT FRET! I am happily winning that battle thanks to everyone here in Fidelity! I also play basketball I was a Point Guard for Team Mistic in a Catholic FIBA league. Don't ask to 1v1 me I am terrible now. Lastly, I love to sing! I may not be the best, or have a voice of an angel, but it is something I enjoy doing so much!</p>

I'm basically a boomer in the world of e-sports, so my role in Team Fidelity other than being a Co-Founder is essentially planning, document drafting and reviewing, and just general organizing of the aspects of the team. I'm a massive firearms enthusiast and am also very interested in JDMs, TCGs, and drawing anime tiddies. Other than that, if you strike up a conversation about a topic I know a thing or two in, be warned now that I will never stop talking about it and randomly send you memes or cool pictures about them. Somehow I've managed to stay in Immortal despite my boomer reaction times, so now I can tell kids to git gud.</p>

I was a huge Overwatch nerd then fell in to this love/hate relationship I currently have with Valorant. Im the guy who loves to listen and am super open minded. I'm looking forward to growing with this amazing family we have here in Team Fidelity. I'm a family oriented person. I am the oldest out of 5 so I'm used to having to lead by example, and taking responsibility over a lot. My dream was always to become apart of a gaming organization and to see what it feels like to be apart of a team and compete in tournaments. Now I just strive with the little free time I have to be the best player I can be! My role in Fidelity is the Promoter I help with in house events and getting people to participate in the various activities we have here in Fidelity. If u have any other questions feel free to ask.</p>
